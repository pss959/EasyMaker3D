+ Camera object in scene should be used during rendering to set up the view.

+ Need 1 Camera for VR and 1 for OpenGL

+ Have to be able to:
   + Translate Gantry (change height)
   + Rotate camera in GLFWViewer

+ Get rid of View and render Camera in scene directly?
   - Viewer needs to find Camera and pass to Renderer.

+ Scene
  * Gantry
    * VRCamera
    * WindowCamera

+ Pass camera to Viewer when initializing it
   Viewer then can update Camera fields and pass frustum to Renderer

+ Move both viewers to Viewers/. Change IViewer to Viewer and move to Viewers.
  + Move EmitEvents() to Viewer class. Only viewers are emitting events.
  + Refactor OpenXR stuff; want to put handler in separate file.
  + Also move handling out of GLFWViewer (checking for escape).
