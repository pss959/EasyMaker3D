Laying out Models Precisely
---------------------------

This tutorial illustrates |appname| features to lay objects out precisely along
lines and circular arcs. These features use the :ref:`Point Target<ug-targets>`
and :ref:`Edge Target<ug-targets>`; so check out the tutorials on them before
this one.

The Edge Target length and direction are used to lay out multiple models along
a line.

For radial layout, the ring on the Point Target can be dragged out to the
desired radius. Interactive spokes are then exposed to let you change the
starting and ending angles for the layout.
