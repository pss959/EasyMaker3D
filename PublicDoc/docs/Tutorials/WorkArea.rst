The Stage
.........

:vidref:`WorkArea:Stage`
:ugref:`ug-stage`

The stage is the large circular platform on which models are placed. It can be
rotated and scaled to change the size and orientation of the models.
:ref:`Modified-clicking <ug-modified-mode>` anywhere on the stage resets it to
its default size and rotation.

Tooltips
........

:vidref:`WorkArea:Tooltips`
:ugref:`ug-tooltips`

All 3D icons and most other interative objects show a tooltip when hovered

Changing the View
.................

:vidref:`WorkArea:Viewing`
:ugref:`ug-viewing`

The slider on the pole on the right changes the camera height. Dragging
anywhere with the right mouse button rotates the camera view.  Clicking on the
pole or the slider resets the height to the default. :ref:`Modified-clicking
<ug-modified-mode>` on the pole or slider resets the view direction in addition
to the height.

3D Icons and Shelves
....................

:vidref:`WorkArea:Shelves`
:ugref:`ug-actions`

Clicking on any 3D icon performs some action or activates some tool. The 3D
icons are organized into shelves in the work area:

  - Icons on the :ref:`Session shelf <ug-session-shelf>` (bottom center) open
    interactive panels for performing session-related operations.
  - Icons on the :ref:`Layout shelf <ug-layout-shelf>` (middle center) help
    with more precise layout of models.
  - Icons on the :ref:`Basic Operations shelf <ug-basics-shelf>` (top center)
    implement undo, redo, etc.
  - Icons on the :ref:`Model Creation shelves <ug-creation-shelves>` (bottom
    two shelves on the left) create new models and drop them on the stage.
  - Icons on the :ref:`General Tool shelf <ug-general-tool-shelf>` (third from
    bottom on the left) activate a general tool for modifying selected models.
  - Icons on the :ref:`Conversion shelf <ug-conversion-shelf>` (third from top
    on the left) convert selected models to a different type for specialized
    editing.
  - Icons on the :ref:`Combination shelf <ug-combination-shelf>` (second from
    top on the left) create new models by combining selected models.
  - The single icon on the :ref:`Specialized shelf <ug-specialized-shelf>` (top
    on the left) switches between the current general tool and the specialized
    tool for the selected models.
  - Icons on the :ref:`Viewing shelf <ug-viewing-shelf>` (top right) deal with
    viewing models.

The Tree Panel
..............

:vidref:`WorkArea:TreePanel`
:ugref:`ug-tree-panel`

The panel on the back wall is the :ref:`Tree Panel <ug-tree-panel>`. It shows
the name of the current session and the model tree. It also allows you to hide
models and to select them.

Other features
..............

:vidref:`WorkArea:Other`
:ugref:`ug-precision`

Above the shelves on the back wall is the Precision Control. This shows the
current precision level for linear and angular operations and allows you to
change it.

The Exit Sign on the back wall exits the application. If you have made changes,
it asks you to confirm before exiting.
