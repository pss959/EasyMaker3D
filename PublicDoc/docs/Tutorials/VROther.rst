Other VR Features
-----------------

This tutorial shows some other VR-related features of |appname|.

:vidref:`VROther:RadialMenus` :ugref:`ug-radial-menus` Since holding
controllers makes it awkward to use the conventional keyboard for shortcuts,
radial menus can be very useful. Pressing the menu button on a controller
displays a radial menu attached to the controller's avatar. The touchpad or
joystick can be used to activate buttons on the menu. Pressing the menu button
again hides the menu.

:vidref:`VROther:Inspector` :ugref:`ug-inspector-mode` Activating inspector
mode with a controller, either by clicking with the pinch action on the 3D
inspector icon on the :ref:`viewing shelf <ug-viewing-shelf>` or by
long-pressing with the pinch action on a model, attaches a copy of the model to
that controller's avatar. This makes it easy to inspect the model from all
angles by just turning and moving the controller.
