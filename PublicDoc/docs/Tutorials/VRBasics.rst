Basic VR Interaction
--------------------

This tutorial covers the basics of using |appname| with VR devices.

:vidref:`VRBasics:Modes` You can use |appname| in either :ref:`full VR mode
:<ug-vr-modes>` (with the headset on) or ref:`hybrid mode <ug-vr-modes>` (with
:the headset off). In either mode, the controllers work in conjunction with the
:mouse and keyboard, so any combination is supported.

The two main types of VR interaction are:
  - :vidref:`VRBasics:Laser` :ugref:`ug-pinch` Laser pointer/pinch, which is
    equivalent to mouse interaction.
  - :vidref:`VRBasics:Grip` :ugref:`ug-grip-dragging` Grip dragging, which is
    customized for different actions.
