Interacting with Panels in VR
-----------------------------

This tutorial covers the use of VR controllers with 2D panels in |appname|.

:vidref:`VRPanels:Touch` :ugref:`ug-touch-mode` When an :ref:`application panel
<ug-application-panels>` or :ref:`tool panel <ug-tool-panels>` is visible,
|appname| enters panel touch mode. In this mode, touch affordances are added to
the controller avatars and panels are positioned closer to the viewer. This
allows you to interact with certain panel UI elements by touching them with the
affordance.

:vidref:`VRPanels:Move` :ugref:`ug-moving-resizing-panels` Grip dragging can be
used to move and resize panels, using the handles on the sides and corners.

:vidref:`VRPanels:VirtualKeyboard` :ugref:`ug-virtual-keyboard-panel` When a
text input field is activated in full VR mode (with the headset on), a virtual
keyboard panel appears. You can use the touch affordances to activate keys on
this keyboard. In hybrid mode (headset off), you can use the regular keyboard.
