Selecting Models and Attaching Tools
------------------------------------

New Models
..........

:vidref:`Selection:NewModels`
When a new model is created, it is selected by default. The currently-selected
model always has some sort of tool attached to it. If the model has a
:ref:`specialized tool <ug-specialized-tools>`, that tool is attached when the
model is created. Otherwise, the current :ref:`general tool <ug-general-tools>`
is attached.

Switching Tools
...............

:vidref:`Selection:SwitchingTools`
If the selected model has a specialized tool, you can switch between the
current general tool and the specialized tool by clicking the icon on the top
left shelf or with the :shortcut:`Space` keyboard shortcut.

You can always switch to any of the general tools by clicking on its 3D icon on
the :ref:`general tools shelf <ug-general-tool-shelf>`. There are also keyboard
shortcuts for switching general tools. See the :ref:`Cheat Sheet <cheat-sheet>`
for details.

Selecting Multiple Models
.........................

:vidref:`Selection:Multiple`

:ref:`Modified-clicking <ug-modified-mode>` (with the shift key or
double-clicking allows you to select more than one model at a time. The first
selected model (primary selection) always has the current tool attached to it,
and the other selected models (secondary selections) have a passive tool (blue
box) attached to it to show that they are selected.

Some general and specialized tools support editing of multiple objects. The
icon for that editor will be enabled (not dark) when this occurs.

Clicking in any non-interactive area (walls, floor, etc.) deselects all
currently-selected models. (Note that the stage is interactive!) There are also
other keyboard shortcuts for changing the selection. Again, see the :ref:`Cheat
Sheet <cheat-sheet>` for details.
