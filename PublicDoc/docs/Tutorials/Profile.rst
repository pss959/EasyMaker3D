Editing Profiles
----------------

This tutorial covers the feature of the profile editor used in these four
tools:

  - :ugref:`ug-bevel-tool` Bevel Tool 
  - :ugref:`ug-extruded-tool` Extruded Tool
  - :ugref:`ug-rev-surf-tool` RevSurf Tool
  - :ugref:`ug-bevel-tool` Taper Tool

Profile editing is mostly consistent among these tools, with a few differences:

  - The endpoints of the profile in the Bevel Tool are fixed; they cannot be
    moved or deleted.
  - The profile in the Extruded Tool must have at least 3 points and form a
    closed loop; all points are movable.
  - The endpoints of the profile in the RevSurf tool are fixed; they cannot be
    moved or deleted. Also, there must be at least 3 points in the profile.
  - The endpoints in the Taper Tool may be moved horizontally, but not
    vertically.
