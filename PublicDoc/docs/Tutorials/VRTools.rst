Interacting with Tools in VR
----------------------------

This tutorial covers the use of VR controllers with various tools.

:vidref:`VRTools:Intro` The laser pointer and pinch action can be used just
like the mouse for any tool (or other interactive feature). However, dragging
tools with the laser pointer can be awkward. Dragging with the grip button is
much easier and more stable.

Pressing the center button on either controller's trackpad or joystick is a
shortcut that :ref:`switches between the current general and specialized tool
<ug-toggle-specialized-tool>`.

Pressing the up or down button on either controller's trackpad or joystick is a
shortcut that increases or decreases the :ref:`current precision level
<ug-precision-level>`, even during a drag.

The general rule for grip dragging is that the direction of the :ref:`grip
hover guide <ug-grip-dragging>` determines which part of the current tool will
be affected by the drag. The controller avatar will show a color-coded
connection to the active part. Specifics for translation
:vidref:`VRTools:Translation`, scaling :vidref:`VRTools:Scale`, and rotating
:vidref:`VRTools:Rotate` are illustrated in the video.

:vidref:`VRTools:Panel` Grip-dragging also works with certain elements of
panels when the grip hover guide is pointed toward the panel.
:vidref:`VRTools:Other` It also works with some other tools, such as the
:ref:`Complexity Tool <ug-complexity-tool>` and :ref:`Color Tool
<ug-color-tool>`.
