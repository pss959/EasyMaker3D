|appname| Quickstart
====================

Installing and Running |appname|
--------------------------------

Open the `the download site <download_site_>`_ (on Google Drive) in a browser
and download the Zip file for your operating system. Extract all files wherever
you like; this will create a |appname| folder. In this folder there is a
|appname| executable that you can click on to run the application.

A Simple Doorstop Example (Non-VR)
----------------------------------

This example will use |appname| in non-VR mode to create a simple doorstop
model and output it as an STL file.

Start the Application
.....................

Starting the application should open a maximized window that you can interact
with using the keyboard and mouse. The first thing you should see is a panel
that lets you interact with |appname| sessions. Click on the `Start new
session` button to start a new session (or just hit the escape key).

Create and Position a Torus
...........................

Click on the 3D torus icon on the bottom-left shelf to drop a new torus model
into the scene. The torus will have some interactive handles attached to it
that you can use to change the sizes of the outer and inner radii. You can
leave them at their default sizes for this example. If you change them and want
to undo your changes, you can click on the 3D undo icon on the top shelf on the
back wall or use Ctrl-Z.

Next you will move the torus a little to the right.  Hit the space bar to
switch from the specialized torus tool to the general translation tool.

Drag the handle on the right side of the torus to the right until it has moved
5 units. You will notice that as you drag the torus, feedback appears to show
you the direction and distance you have moved.

Create a Cylinder and Change Its Size

Setting up VR
-------------

Feel free to skip these section if you do not have a VR headset or you just
don't want to use it.

Some VR experiences allow you or force you to walk around while using them.
That wouldn't make sense for this application, so it is designed to make
everything useful from one spot. If you're planning to use the VR mode, set it
up for a comfortable, fixed standing or seated position. Note that the scene
view is set up for sitting, so you may need to adjust your VR positioning for a
different height if you prefer to stand.

|appname| was developed using an HTC Vive and Oculus Quest 2 (since that's what
I have), but should work with any standard VR controllers supported by `SteamVR
<https://www.steamvr.com>`_. If not, `contact the author
<https://github.com/pss959>`_ for help.
