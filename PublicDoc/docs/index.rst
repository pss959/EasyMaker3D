|appname| is a VR-enabled application for creating 3D-printable models.
"VR-enabled" means that it can be used in VR, but also works in a standard
mouse+keyboard configuration. It can also be used in VR without the headset
on. In that mode, you can use any combination of VR controllers, mouse, and
keyboard.

You can create many different types of models and then save them as STL files
that can be sent to a 3D printer.

MakerVR is available for Windows and Linux. There is also a Mac version, but it
may or not work in VR due to the `lack of official SteamVR support
<https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/2216278054495230717>`_.
