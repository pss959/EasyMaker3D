Revised Outline extension for Python-Markdown
=============================================

Wraps the document logical sections (as implied by h1-h6 headings) in "section"
tags with class "section1" through "section6"

This is derived from the outdated mdx_outline extension and fixed to work with
Python >= 3.9 and mkdocs >= 1.2.1
