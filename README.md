# EasyMaker3D

EasyMaker3D is a desktop application for building models for 3D printing. It is
aimed at users who may not have much experience with creating 3D models. It is
much easier to learn to use than most modeling applications.

Full user documentation, including installation instructions, a quickstart, and
a user guide, can be found on the [EasyMaker3D Github documentation
site](https://pss959.github.io/EasyMaker3D/latest).

Anyone interested in the code can find more information in the [EasyMaker3D
Github wiki](https://github.com/pss959/EasyMaker3D/wiki).
